				<p>The maze is a 3D game rendered from a 2D map using a technique known as raycasting.

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This is a 3D game rendered from a 2D map using a technique known as raycasting. Team
				members were Kibirt Bayou C and I. The project mainly focused on raycasting, which is
				projecting a 2D map to
				a navigatable 3D map. Later on adding features that you would find in a game, like
				rotating the camera and
				moving the player. <br><br>
				Think of ray casting like this, we can use a rectangle shape to represent a room in 2D,
				now imagine yourself in that
				room, you see an upright wall, so the task is drawing those upright walls and from just
				the rectangle, and that
				simply is raycasting. <br><br>
				We both worked on writing the code since that was an integral
				part of
				the project. This
				project was an attempt to obtain some knowledge and experience on the multimedia
				title development process
				using SDL - Simple DirectMedia Layer library.<br><br>
				Simple DirectMedia Layer(SDL) is a cross-platform software development library designed
				to provide a hardware
				abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components, to provide low level
				access to audio, keyboard, mouse,
				joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.</p>
